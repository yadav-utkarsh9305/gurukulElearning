  <h2> << Understanding eLearning Platforms</h2> <br>
The field of electronic learning (or “eLearning”) has gained increasing popularity, and for the right reasons. Over the last few years, intuitive online learning platforms has seen leaps in offering a complete learning experience that is fun, interactive, and ultimately engaging.
<br>
 <h2> << What is an eLearning System?</h2> <br>
An electronic learning platform is an integrated set of interactive online services that provide trainers, learners, and others involved in education with information, tools, and resources to support and enhance education delivery and management. One type of eLearning platform is a learning management system (LMS).
<br>
There are many eLearning companies out there that offer online learning platforms. Some of these virtual learning environment platforms allow you to host and sell online courses, allowing you to run your own business. Other platforms simply offer an interface in which users can interact with your content but might not be the best fit for your audience. So how do you decide which platform is the best to host your training courses?
<br>
In the end, you’re going to choose the eLearning platform that presents your course in an engaging way for your learners. To help you decide how to differentiate between different LMS options, we’ve created a shortlist of the most important aspects to consider when choosing the right platform.
<br>
<h2> << How to Choose the Best eLearning Platform</h2> <br>
The purpose of a successful eLearning platform is that it creates a robust learning experience that feels like a classroom experience, offering the traditional classroom characteristics (like instructor-student interaction, Q&As, discussion, games, collaborative projects, quizzes, etc.) but either online or through a device (e.g. a laptop, desktop, tablet or mobile.) These important learning environments are achieved through a learning platform’s features and tools that create the level of interaction and engagement students need.
<br>
<h2> << Learning Formats</h2> <br>
Just as there are many learning styles for different types of learners, the online learning platform you choose should be able to host different content formats to address your learner’s specific learning styles. Some examples of content formats include articles, interviews, webinars, charts, PowerPoint presentations,  simulations and video, but these are just a select few examples of content formats that can be used in eLearning.
<br>
Learning platforms should also include content modules, learning modules, evaluation modules, and communication modules. These modules allow for your training program to incorporate a variety of teaching styles for every learner, and allows for learners to boost their performance level and knowledge-retention levels.
<br>
<h2> << Use Cases</h2> <br>
It’s also important to consider any special requirements your eLearning platform will need in your business industry. For instance, if your company employees work remotely, you’ll need an eLearning platform that can be easily deployed to different devices, like mobile phones, tablets, and laptops. Or, if you’re in healthcare, your eLearning platform will likely need to be integrated into existing systems, like your hospital management system.
<br>
Questions to Ask About an eLearning Platform
Circling back to learning platforms, let’s look at some of the important questions to answer when assessing your LMS options and picking the best one for your needs.

<br>


<h2> << Is your LMS Mobile-Friendly?</h2>
Almost everyone carries their mobile phones with them at all times! No matter your industry, learners prefer to have accessibility
